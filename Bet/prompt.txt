You are an expert Solana smart contract developer specializing in Anchor framework. Your task is to generate a complete, secure, and efficient smart contract implementing a Bet contract with the following specifications:

Contract Requirements:
1. Participants: Two players and one oracle.
2. Parameters at deployment:
   - deadline: Time limit (e.g., current block height + fixed constant).
   - oracle: Address of the user acting as the oracle.
3. Actions:
   - join: Both players deposit equal bets (in native cryptocurrency).
   - win: After both players join, the oracle declares the winner, who receives the entire pot.
   - timeout: If the oracle fails to choose a winner by the deadline, both players can redeem their bets.
4. Required Functionalities:
   - Native tokens handling.
   - Multisig transactions support.
   - Time constraints (deadline enforcement).
   - Transaction revert for invalid operations.

Function Signatures:
- join(ctx: Context<JoinCtx>, delay: u64, wager: u64) -> Result<()>
- win(ctx: Context<WinCtx>) -> Result<()>
- timeout(ctx: Context<TimeoutCtx>) -> Result<()>

Additional Context:
- Use Anchor framework best practices.
- Include proper error handling (e.g., require checks for deadlines, equal wagers, and oracle authorization).
- Ensure the contract is secure against reentrancy and front-running.
- Optimize for gas efficiency where possible.

Examples for Clarity:
1. join:
   - Input: Players deposit 1 SOL each with a deadline of 100 blocks.
   - Output: Contract state updates to reflect both players' deposits.
2. win:
   - Input: Oracle calls win and specifies the winner before the deadline.
   - Output: Winner receives 2 SOL; contract state is closed.
3. timeout:
   - Input: Deadline passes without oracle action.
   - Output: Players reclaim their 1 SOL each; contract state is closed.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Initialize: Set up the contract with deadline and oracle.
2. Join: Players deposit funds; validate equal wagers and multisig.
3. Win: Oracle selects winner; validate deadline and authorization.
4. Timeout: Allow refunds if deadline is exceeded.

Provide the complete Anchor smart contract code, including all necessary structs, contexts, and instructions. Comment critical sections for clarity.
